\qmltype PermissionRequest
\inqmlmodule com.canonical.Oxide 1.0
\instantiates OxideQPermissionRequest

\brief Generic permission request

PermissionRequest represents a request for permission to access a specific
resource. The permission request does not indicate the type of resource that the
request is for, but instead, this is indicated by the source of the request.

It is assumed that the application will display a UI to request permission from
the user.

The origin of the site that this request originates from can be accessed using
\l{origin}.

The application can respond to this request by calling \l{allow} (which will
permit access to the resource) or \l{deny} (which will deny access to the
resource).

If the request instance is deleted before the application has called \l{allow}
or \l{deny}, the request will be automatically declined.
*/

/*!
\qmlproperty url PermissionRequest::origin
\since OxideQt 1.8

The origin of the page requesting access to the resource.
*/

/*!
\qmlproperty url PermissionRequest::embedder

The origin of the top-level page that hosts the page requesting access to the
resource.

If the request originates from the main frame, this will be equal to
\l{origin}.
*/

/*!
\qmlproperty url PermissionRequest::url
\deprecated
*/

/*!
\qmlproperty bool PermissionRequest::isCancelled

The permission request has been cancelled. This could be because the originating
frame navigated to another page or was deleted.

If the application is displaying a permission request UI to the user, it should
hide it when this property indicates that the request has been cancelled.
*/

/*!
\qmlmethod void PermissionRequest::allow()

Permit access to the resource for which this permission request requests access,
for the specified \l{origin} / \l{embedder} combination.
*/

/*!
\qmlmethod void PermissionRequest::deny()

Decline access to the resource for which this permission request requests
access.

PermissionRequest for details of the inherited functionality.
