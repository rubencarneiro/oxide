Oxide is built without run-time type information (RTTI), regardless of the
compiler flags passed in to the build system. This breaks consumers outside of
the core Oxide library if they are built with RTTI enabled (ie, without
"-fno-rtti"). Consumers that are built with RTTI will fail to link if they
construct instances of classes from objects without RTTI, if those classes
have a vtable. In order to avoid constraining consumers, we build all public
classes with RTTI.

All objects in this folder (excluding those in private/) are compiled with RTTI.
When working on these files, please remember that you can't construct instances
of classes with vtables from objects that are built anywhere else in Oxide or
Chromium.
