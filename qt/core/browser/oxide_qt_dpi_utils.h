// Interaction with most of Qt is done in device-independent pixels, with (in
// 5.6) Qt performing conversions between device-independent pixels and native
// pixels (which is what the underlying windowing system uses). The conversion
// is based on the pixel ratio of the screen, which is provided by the
// platform's QPA plugin. On X11, native pixels are equivalent to physical
// pixels, whereas on OSX they are scaled already by the OS.
// On Ubuntu / Mir, no scaling is done in Qt - it's performed in the UI toolkit,
// which sits above Oxide and we interact with Qt in physical pixels, which
// means we have to do scaling manually. That's what this class is for - it
// also allows us to apply an override scale for testing.
//
// Some terms to consider when using this class:
// - Physical pixels - shouldn't really need explaining
// - Chromium pixels - These are fully-scaled device-independent pixels used
//   in the interface between qt/ and shared/
// - Qt pixels - These are what we interface to Qt with - they may be device
//   indepdendent or physical pixels, depending on the platform. And they don't
//   have any additional scale applied to them
