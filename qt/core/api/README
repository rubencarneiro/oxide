*** IMPORTANT ***
Chromium (and hence, Oxide) is built without run-time type information (RTTI).
However, this breaks consumers that generally assume RTTI exists (ie, they don't
compile with the "-fno-rtti" flag). Consumers that are built with RTTI will fail
to link if they construct instances of classes from objects that aren't built
with RTTI, if those classes have a vtable. In order to avoid constraining
consumers, we build all public classes with RTTI.

All objects in this folder (excluding everything in the private subfolder) are
compiled with RTTI. When working on these files, please keep in consideration
the following 2 restrictions:

1) You can't use dynamic_cast on instances of classes from elsewhere in Oxide
   or Chromium (I shouldn't need to explain this!)
2) You can't construct instances of classes with virtual functions from
   objects that are built anywhere else in Oxide or Chromium. If you need to
   construct a new instance of a class, ensure that the constructor is called
   from an object that isn't built with RTTI, and return a pointer to the fully
   constructed object (ie, have the private class provide a static
   "Class::Create()" function)
