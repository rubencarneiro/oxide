*** IMPORTANT ***
Chromium (and hence, Oxide) is built without run-time type information (RTTI).
However, this breaks consumers that generally assume RTTI exists (ie, they don't
compile with the "-fno-rtti" flag). In order to avoid constraining consumers,
we build all public classes with RTTI.

All objects in this folder are compiled with RTTI. When working on these files,
please keep in consideration the following 2 restrictions:

1) You can't use dynamic_cast on instances of classes from elsewhere in Oxide
   (I shouldn't need to explain this!)
2) You can't construct instances of classes with virtual functions from
   anywhere else in Oxide. If you need to construct a new instance of a class,
   ensure that the constructor is called from an object that isn't built with
   RTTI, and return a pointer to the fully constructed object (ie, have the
   private class provide a static "Class::Create()" function)
